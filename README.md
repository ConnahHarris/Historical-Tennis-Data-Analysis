# Historical Tennis Match Outcome Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project explores historical ATP tennis match data to identify the key factors that influence match outcomes and to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the winner of future matches.

## Data

The data is sourced from the publically available Jeff Sackmann ATP database (https://github.com/JeffSackmann), which contains detailed match-level data for professional tennis matches.
